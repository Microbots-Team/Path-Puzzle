# 🧩 Path Puzzle

An interactive **AI-powered puzzle game** where players must discover the correct order of objects along a defined path.  
If the sequence is correct, the objects successfully cross; if not, the path throws them off.  
The project combines **artificial intelligence**, **computer vision**, and **robotics** to deliver a logical and engaging interactive experience.
